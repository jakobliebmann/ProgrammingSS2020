# Setup

First, we load the tidyverse package.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then, we need to install the package `nycflights13`. The package contains the following five datasets: _airlines_, _airports_, _planes_, _weather_, and _flights_. For explanations on the data use `help(airlines)`, `help(airports)`, etc. To make the data visible in the global environment we need to assign them to some variable.

```{r}
airlines <- nycflights13::airlines 
airports <- nycflights13::airports
planes <- nycflights13::planes
weather <- nycflights13::weather
flights <- nycflights13::flights
```

# Analyse data
## Airlines
- Inspect the airlines data and print the first 5 rows.
```{r}
airlines %>%
  head(5)
```


## Airports 
- Inspect the airports data and print the first rows. 
```{r}
airports %>%
  head(5)
```

- The variabe `alt` represents the airport's altitude in feet. Replace `alt` by the corresponding altitude in meters (meter = feet * 3.28084). Then filter for the 5 airports with the highest altitude
```{r}
airports <- airports %>%
  mutate(alt = alt/3.28084)

airports %>%
  arrange(desc(alt)) %>%
  head(5)
```

- Filter for all airports which are located at an altitude lower than sea level
```{r}
airports %>%
  filter(alt < 0)
```

## Weather
- Inspect the data and print the first rows. 
```{r}
weather[1:3,]
```

- Does the data only cover New York or also the weather at destination airports? 
```{r}
weather$origin %>%
  unique()

# covers only NY
```

- Change the units to European standards:  
  * Temperature (`temp`) and dew point (`dewp`): Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 
  * Visibility (`visib`): kilometer = miles / 1.60934
  * Wind speed (`wind_speed`): kilometer/hour = (miles/hour) /1.60934
  * Precipitation (`precip`): millimeter = inches * 20.54
```{r}
weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(temp = (temp - 32)*5/9, 
         dewp = (dewp - 32)*5/9,
         visib = visib * 1.60934,
         wind_speed = wind_speed * 1.60934,
         precip = precip * 20.54
         )
```
  
- What was the 2013 average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  summarise("avg temp (°C)" = round(mean(temp, na.rm = T),1), 
            "avg wind speed (km/h)" = round(mean(wind_speed, na.rm = T),1),
            "avg visib (km)" = round(mean(visib, na.rm = T), 1)
            )
  
```

- What was the *monthly* average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise("avg temp (°C)" = round(mean(temp, na.rm = T),1), 
            "avg wind speed (km/h)" = round(mean(wind_speed, na.rm = T),1),
            "avg visib (km)" = round(mean(visib, na.rm = T), 1)
            ) 
  
  
```

- What was the minimum `temp`, the maximum `temp`, and the total amount of `precip` at each of the 3 airports in December 2013? 
```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(month == "12") %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise("min temp (°C)" = min(temp, na.rm = T),
            "max temp (°C)" = max(temp, na.rm = T),
            "total precip (mm)" = sum(precip, na.rm = T)
            )
```


## Planes
- Inspect the planes data and print the first 5 rows.
```{r}
planes[1:5,]
```

- Count the numer of planes per `manufacturer` and sort in descending order? 
```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(tailnum)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

- Calculate per manufacturer: 1. number of planes, 2. average number of `seats`, 3. average number of `engines`, 4. average `year` when the planes where manufactured. And again order in descending order of the number of planes
```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise("planes" = n_distinct(tailnum),
            "Avg number of seats" = round(mean(seats, na.rm = T),1),
            "Avg. number of engines" = round(mean(engines, na.rm = T),1),
            "Avg. year of construction" = round(mean(year, na.rm = T))
            ) %>%
  arrange(desc(planes))
```

## Flights
- Inspect the flights data and print the first 5 rows.
```{r}
flights[1:5,]
```

- Count the total number of flights and the average delay during the whole year per `hour` of departure.
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarise(flights = n_distinct(flight),
            avg_delay = round(mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),1),
            )
```

- Count the number of flights by destionation airport (`dest`) and arrange them in descending order.
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(flights = n_distinct(flight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(flights))
```


# Join datasets 
Join the five data sets into one large data set. To better understand the relationship between them, study the file _img/table_realtionships.PNG_ (or alternatively knit this Rmd file.) 

![](img/table_relationships.PNG){width=70%}
```{r}
# nö!
```


# Freely explore
Some questions for inspiration:

- Do smaller planes (as measured by the number of seats) have less departure delay?
- What is the average flight distance and the average delay by airline
- What's the average delay by airline? (But note that this will be strongly correlated with flight distance, 
- Is bad weather (precipitation, low visibility, low temperatures) related to departure delay? 
```{r}
# nö!
```
